## Creative Platform X Polygon Blockchain: Getting Artists In Shape

> ‚ÄúThis is a story, all about how‚Ä¶ Some artists and developers figured out how‚Ä¶ to take creatives in the market making NFTs, and turn a profit with collabs on multi-chains with ETH‚Ä¶‚Äù (written to the tune of Will Smith's theme for ‚ÄúThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.‚Äù)

Now, if you're unfamiliar with the popular American sitcom of the '90s, I feel for you. However, if you were able to deduce what the previous jingle was remixed from, then continue reading! 

## What‚Äôs the Use?
Creative is a platform where creators, fans, and brands come together and use their God-given  talents to work for them--for good. Simply put, artists, singers, designers, painters, etc., should get paid a fair, competitive, and consistent living wage, with comparable benefits to more traditional careers in our society. From small projects, to large, complex, and influential organizations, Creative will provide services such as artist-direct streaming royalties, artist-brand collabs and sponsorships (which can be voted on by fans and members of integrated blockchain platforms), and interactive fan engagement, with perks such as rewards in our native CRTV token, special/exclusive NFT drops, or even access to public and private events within the Creative community. 

## A Developer‚Äôs Solution
For many developers looking for a career in the blockchain space, they may stumble upon the growing behemoth of the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum has steadily become the safe haven to bringing feasible utility and use cases to the ideas within decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). All of these different protocols, technologies, and users jam the circuits of Ethereum, often resulting in high transaction fees. So Polygon (formerly known as MATIC), sought to solve this issue for us all‚Ä¶ Let's check in with how well they're doing on that quest!  

## The Move to Bel-Air
Polygon combines the best of Ethereum and sovereign blockchains into a full-fledged multichain system. When considering pain points associated with blockchains, like high gas fees and slow speeds, Polygon solves these issues without sacrificing security by using a multichain system, comparable to others like Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche, etc. Creative took the opportunity to partner with POLY for at least these three major upsides:

## SUITE OF BENEFITS
 1) It fully benefits from Ethereum‚Äôs network effect; meaning our native DeFi smart contracts  (developed in-house), which will be attached to the DAO of Creative, shall benefit greatly from transactions that occur within our community on the Polygon blockchain. As Creative integrates other ETH-compatible protocols via Polygon, it gives creators the opportunity to benefit from a robust level of indie-ready services, brings fans the opportunity to participate in voting and promotional opportunities, and brands the ground-level insight and direct connection with a community around their project, product, or service. 

2) It is inherently secure; which is paramount to the success of any tech platform and organization-- network security. Hosting LIVE events, supporting with multiple servers in the blockchain ecosystem, and even just handling bugs and errors, can all be integrated as an ‚Äú√† la carte‚Äù function for developers on Ethereum. For Creative, it means we get to design an extra tight project with enhanced protection features as we scale. Polygon also offers the ability to select 'Security as a Service,' as an organic response to understanding the landscape of blockchain and DeFi. Scaling for any business or platform is always difficult, but working with Polygon gives Creative a decided advantage for accessing the best developers, while leveraging a great project with clear upside.

3) It is powerful and open to all; eventually. Creative plans to publish NFTs on the behalf of Creative members and fans to larger marketplaces such as OpenSea, Rarible, Mintable, and more in the future. Rather than Creative taking ownership of utility licenses for each creator, a decentralized network of blockchains will independently service our platform. By distributing metadata through secure peer-to-peer networks, developers can unite with Creative to design partner/sponsor agreements, which can be written into smart contracts, that turn into alliances with other DAOs through crowdfunding, direct payment, portfolio lending, member rewards staking, and transferring data with great efficiency.

‚ÄúWe pulled data since the beginning of 2021, looking for ways to alleviate network transaction fees (gas fees) in order to develop projects and scale the Creative network. Not only has Polygon worked tirelessly as partners to support our integration, but they have the exact infrastructure that will make Creative a platform where devs understand and value our mission, as well as give our users a unique and seamless experience.‚Äù -- Creative Marketing Team

## The Workout Plan: Wallet Integration 
As Creative gets closer to the beta launch, Polygon will play an instrumental role with our wallet partner Venly, an app with a built-in on-ramp to NFT marketplaces. This will be a benefit not only the for NFTs that are designed and minted within our Creative community, but off-chain users have the opportunity to learn and seek the power of the Ethereum network, and what blockchain technology can do for them.
